# IR 2023 Final Project
Repo for the final project. Install with the following command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
``` 

Experiments can be run all at once with the experiment.py or as a jupyter notebook with experiment.ipynb.

Our index used for this experiement is too large and could not be stored with the submitted zip file.

The index can be downloaded and unzipped by running
```
wget https://cs.rit.edu/~bsg8294/msmarco_index.zip
unzip msmarco_index.zip
```
